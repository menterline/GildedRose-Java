# Gilded Rose Java

this is my take on the classic Gilded Rose Kata by implementing a strategy pattern.  My strategy for getting to this final state was to write tests on the existing code and make sure that was in a passing state.  This allows me to make changes to the code without fear of changing existing behavior.
